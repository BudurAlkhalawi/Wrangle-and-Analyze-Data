# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

Real-world data rarely come clean. Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.
The dataset that I wrangle (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
